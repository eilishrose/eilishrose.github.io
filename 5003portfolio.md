The module materials guide us through creating a model with agents.

* The model builds agents in a space and gets them to interact with each other.
* The model reads in environmental data, and gets agents to interact with the environment;
* The code displays the model as an animation and it is contained within a GUI;

Above is a screenshot of the model after it has run 100 iterations with 10 agents
