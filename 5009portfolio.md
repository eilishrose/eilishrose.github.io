## Hello World
### A GitHub site for my current projects.

### 5009 Portfolio

The module materials guides us through various tasks related to R Studio. I managed to create the plots to some extent in the excercises, but I felt as if I did not understand the code as completely as I could have. 

### Issues during development

* I had some significant issues with knitting to PDF and including graphics. This caused some last minute errors that meant I needed to host the output images here.
* I additionally had issues with the alpha in the scatter plots and the legend in the map.

Above are the screenshotted outputs of the code from the various exercises in the module.
